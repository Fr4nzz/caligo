# Design

## Source of truth

- Status: Active
- Last refreshed: 2026-08-06
- Primary product surfaces: bilingual public website at `/en/` and `/es/`
- Evidence reviewed: `README.md`, `src/styles/tokens.css`, `src/styles/global.css`, `src/components/pages/HomePage.astro`, `src/components/HeroMedia.astro`, `src/components/MediaCandidateViewer.astro`, `refs/plan-mejora/04_DIRECCION_VISUAL.md`, and desktop/mobile screenshots supplied during review

## Brand

- Personality: scientifically rigorous, regional, collaborative, confident, and visually grounded in living specimens
- Trust signals: named sources, image credits, clear evidence status, real institutional context, and consistent bilingual presentation
- Avoid: generic technology styling, decorative scientific notation, invented claims, weak caveats, heavy shadows, glow, and text placed over biologically important image detail

## Product goals

- Goals: invite researchers and institutions to understand, trust, and join Caligo
- Non-goals: present unapproved governance as final, imply commitments that do not exist, or turn the site into a publication database
- Success signals: users can understand the initiative, proposed pilot projects, selected scientific questions, leadership, and participation routes without losing source context

## Personas and jobs

- Primary personas: Lepidoptera researchers, taxonomists, genomic facilities, students, funders, collection staff, and potential collaborators
- User jobs: understand the scientific case, inspect proposed work, assess credibility, find collaborators, and join the network
- Key contexts of use: desktop research environments, narrow desktop windows, tablets, and mobile phones in English or Spanish

## Information architecture

- Primary navigation: Home, Science, Pilot projects, About, Participate
- Core routes/screens: `/`, `/science`, `/projects`, `/about`, and `/participate`
- Content hierarchy: Home presents the initiative thesis, priorities, four selected published findings linked to proposed work, and current activity; About explains the name, workflow, principles, leadership, facilities, and wider network context; Science, Pilot projects, and Participate carry their named tasks

## Design principles

- Let biological evidence lead: specimen imagery and scientific diagrams carry meaning, not decoration
- Keep provenance visible: sources, credits, licences, and proposal status remain readable
- Separate content territories: image focal subjects, copy, controls, and attribution must not compete for the same space
- Preserve bilingual parity: English and Spanish use the same hierarchy and equivalent layout quality
- Remove ornamental repetition: navigation already supplies page context, so a page label must not repeat the H1; complete content modules belong on one canonical page
- Make every paragraph earn its place by stating a result, mechanism, question, evidence requirement, or action
- Keep card metadata subordinate: concise image details may collapse when the scientific question and next actions are the primary task
- Tradeoff: preserve a clear subject/copy boundary before maximizing image area or headline width

## Visual language

- Color: Caligo’s warm neutral palette with a burnt-orange accent; hero copy uses fixed ivory on a matte near-black field
- Brand emblem: the extracted mark is transparent on light surfaces; dark mode supplies the logo’s original ivory matte so its negative-space wing markings keep the same colour in both modes
- Social previews: use the dedicated 1200 x 630 text-free share card, with the complete emblem centred inside a square crop-safe area; never rely on a favicon, touch icon, or full logo lockup as a platform fallback
- Typography: Space Grotesk for display, Inter for prose and UI, JetBrains Mono for labels and provenance. Shared editorial roles in `global.css` define one cross-page hierarchy: heading (`--step-2`), lead and body (`--step-0`), metadata (`--step--1`), and uppercase labels (`--step--2`). Page components own layout and emphasis, not independent type scales. Home editorial sections remain an intentional restrained local exception so ordinary laptop viewports do not feel browser-zoomed.
- Spacing/layout rhythm: wide specimen-plate compositions followed by restrained content sections
- Shape/radius/elevation: hairlines, small radii, and minimal elevation
- Motion: user-controlled only when sequence matters; final-state comparison diagrams remain static; no generic entrance animation
- Imagery/iconography: credited documentary imagery and code-native diagrams; icons must encode a recognizable concept or action, not merely repeat a type already established by the surrounding heading and content

## Components

- Existing components to reuse: `Base`, `Header`, `HeroMedia`, `CommunityStats`, `PrincipleGrid`, `MediaCandidateViewer`, and shared CTA/button styles
- New/changed components: Home includes a compact three-priority grid, four evidence-to-pilot cards, and a restrained recent/upcoming activity timeline; About presents principles as an open numbered editorial index, retains profile cards for people, keeps the six-step specimen-to-shared-evidence workflow, and consolidates leadership, facilities, and external context under one Caligo network section; Participate includes a concise participation-outcomes list; Home research cards use the compact `MediaCandidateViewer` disclosure so image provenance remains available without competing with the scientific hook; Science pairs Caligo concept diagrams with the corresponding published figures, side by side only when both remain legible; the Home hero may change its internal CSS geometry without creating a parallel hero component; Header and Footer share the transparent, text-free emblem, and the Header uses a responsive brand lockup
- Variants and states: desktop split composition; mobile stacked composition; light/dark page modes do not alter hero contrast
- Token/component ownership: global tokens remain in `src/styles/tokens.css`; reusable editorial type roles remain in `src/styles/global.css`; page-specific CSS owns geometry, spacing exceptions, and accents; hero geometry stays in `HomePage.astro`

## Accessibility

- Target standard: WCAG 2.2 AA
- Keyboard/focus behavior: every CTA, source link, image selector, and image-details disclosure remains keyboard reachable with visible focus
- Contrast/readability: hero text uses the photograph’s naturally dark right side, never the butterfly’s head or eye; no overlay, filter, clipping edge, or added panel may alter the specimen
- Screen-reader semantics: one page `h1`, meaningful photo alternative text, and visible attribution
- Reduced motion and sensory considerations: the hero remains static; explanatory motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Responsive behavior

- Supported breakpoints/devices: approximately 390 px mobile through wide desktop; the critical narrow-desktop boundary is immediately above 60 rem
- Desktop layout above 60 rem: the landscape photograph remains full bleed at its original brightness and composition; copy occupies a stable right-side column over the image’s own dark field, and hero height follows the photograph’s ratio until its wide-screen cap
- Mobile layout at or below 60 rem: the same landscape composition appears first at its intrinsic aspect ratio, followed by a dedicated dark copy field; no alternate crop, overlay, or copy obscures the specimen
- Header lockup: on desktop, the descriptor sits to the right of “Caligo” to keep the sticky header shallow; below the desktop-navigation breakpoint it stacks beneath the name, and at the narrowest mobile width it may be hidden to preserve room for controls
- Intermediate widths: title, body, actions, and attribution may wrap or increase hero height, but they must not cross into the specimen territory
- Validation widths: 390, 960, 961, 1024, 1280, 1440, and 1920 CSS pixels
- Touch/hover differences: full-width mobile CTAs; hover styling is supplemental and never the only state cue

## Interaction states

- Loading: eager hero image with intrinsic dimensions to limit layout shift
- Empty: missing canonical hero media fails at build time
- Error: broken or absent factual media records must not silently render placeholder claims
- Success: primary and secondary hero actions remain visually distinct
- Disabled: not applicable to the static hero
- Offline/slow network: responsive image sources and static copy preserve the page structure

## Content voice

- Tone: direct, concise, scientifically literate, and inviting
- Terminology: use “pilot project” in English and “proyecto piloto” in Spanish
- Microcopy rules: no internal editorial language, no defensive disclaimers that weaken the public presentation, and no facts without a documented source; distinguish current capacity from aspirational outcomes without presenting either as a guarantee
- Scientific copy: prefer a measured result or named biological mechanism over metaphors about genomes as maps, blueprints, instructions, or books

## Implementation constraints

- Framework/styling system: Astro, plain CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Design-token constraints: use existing variables unless a cross-site token is genuinely required
- Performance constraints: no new dependencies and no additional hero asset unless the current responsive sources cannot satisfy the composition
- Compatibility constraints: modern evergreen browsers and CSS without DOM/focus reordering
- Test/screenshot expectations: automated geometry contracts plus browser review in EN/ES at wide desktop, narrow desktop, and 390 px mobile

## Open questions

- None currently block the responsive hero contract.
