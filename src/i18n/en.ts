          "Lepidopteran chromosomes are holocentric. During cell division, the machinery that moves them can attach along much of the chromosome instead of at one localised centromere. A broken fragment can therefore retain the machinery needed to move into a daughter cell. This may help chromosome fissions persist, but it does not explain why they spread through a population.",
